# âš¡ Op-Amps (Operational Amplifiers)

**Scientific and Conceptual Foundations â€“ Modular Synthesizer Course**

---

## ðŸ§  Topic Overview

Operational amplifiers ("Op-Amps") are versatile analog building blocks that amplify voltage signals with extremely high gain. In this course section, students learn:

- The basic ideal Op-Amp assumptions or "Golden Rules"
- How an Op-Amp can be used as a **voltage buffer** (voltage follower)
- How an Op-Amp can be used as an **amplifier** or **comparator**
- How Op-Amps are used in Eurorack modules like VCAs and noise circuits

This foundational knowledge supports building more complex modules, including the White Noise Generator, ADSR, and VCA.

## ðŸ“š Connections to Projects

This topic is a required prerequisite for:

- [White Noise Generator](https://github.com/elandahl/eurorack-course/blob/main/project/03-white-noise-generator/README.md)
- [ADSR Envelope Generator](https://github.com/elandahl/eurorack-course/blob/main/project/04-adsr/README.md)
- [VCA Module](https://github.com/elandahl/eurorack-course/blob/main/project/05-vca/README.md)

Op-Amps also lay the groundwork for understanding active filters and future signal processing modules.
