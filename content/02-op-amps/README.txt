# âš¡ Op-Amps (Operational Amplifiers)

**Scientific and Conceptual Foundations â€“ Modular Synthesizer Course**

---

## ðŸ§  Topic Overview

Operational amplifiers ("Op-Amps") are versatile analog building blocks that amplify voltage signals with extremely high gain. In this course section, students learn:

- The basic ideal Op-Amp assumptions or "Golden Rules"
- How an Op-Amp can be used as a **voltage buffer** (voltage follower)
- How an Op-Amp can be used as a **amplifier**
- How an Op-Amp can be used as a **comparator**

This foundational knowledge supports building more complex modules, including the White Noise Generator and the ADSR Envelope Generator.

## ðŸ“– Lecture Notes and Slides

- ðŸ“„ [Op Amps Lecture Notes](231_Lecture03.tex) â€” LaTeX source
- ðŸ“„ [Op Amps I Slides (PDF)](231_OpAmps_Slides.pdf) â€” ready for students
- ðŸ“„ *Placeholder*: **Op Amps II** lecture notes and slides (coming soon)

Future updates will extend these notes with non-inverting amplifiers, summing amplifiers, and real-world Op-Amp considerations.

## ðŸŽ¥ Video Lectures

- [Op Amp as Buffer â€“ Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNguglM31Zk)
- [Op Amp as Buffer â€“ Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz5SNfB1_mA)

These videos introduce the key idea of the Op-Amp voltage follower and why itâ€™s useful in analog circuits, especially for modular synthesizers.

## ðŸ“š Connections to Projects

This concept is prerequisite for:

- [White Noise Generator](https://github.com/elandahl/eurorack-course/blob/main/project/03-white-noise-generator/README.md)
- [ADSR Envelope Generator](https://github.com/elandahl/eurorack-course/blob/main/project/04-adsr/README.md)
- [VCA Module](https://github.com/elandahl/eurorack-course/blob/main/project/05-vca/README.md)

Understanding Op-Amps is also fundamental for later circuits involving AC signals and filtering.
