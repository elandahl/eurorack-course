# üéöÔ∏è ADSR Envelope Generator

**Project 04 ‚Äì Modular Synthesizer Course**

This module implements an **ADSR envelope generator** using classic 555 and 4017 ICs, along with a network of LEDs, diodes, capacitors, and timing resistors. The ADSR module generates a voltage envelope with four phases:

- **Attack** ‚Äì how fast the envelope rises to its peak
- **Decay** ‚Äì how fast it falls to a sustain level
- **Sustain** ‚Äì the held level as long as the gate is active
- **Release** ‚Äì how fast it falls to zero when the gate is released

These stages control how a sound evolves over time when triggered ‚Äî a core function in modular and analog synthesis.

## üìä Analysis

There is a [video overview of the ADSR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlO4ljZnAc8), including the meaning of envelopes and how to use the simulations.

There are lushprojects simulations of just the [trigger processing circuit](https://tinyurl.com/y66v7bsb)  and the [entire ADSR circuit without internal buffering](https://tinyurl.com/y358uu4k).

A technical analysis of the ADSR circuit ‚Äî including how timing is generated, how capacitors and resistors affect each stage, and how the 555 is used ‚Äî is forthcoming:

## üì¶ Notes on Legacy Files

This directory also includes earlier schematic and project files from prior versions:
- `ADSR.sch`, `ADSR.pro` (original Eagle-imported files)
- `sequencer.*` (related test/development variant)
- `.bak`, `.net`, `.xml` files retained for historical/debugging reference

Please ignore or archive these unless you're doing historical revision or schematic debugging.
