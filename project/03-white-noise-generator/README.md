White Noise Generator
based on design by R. Schmitz
PCB layout by Kevin Thurman and Eric Landahl
Winter Quarter 2021

The transistor is the key component.  The original design calls for a BC548 PNP transistor.
Alternate transistors can change the noise characteristics.  This can be explored by soldering a transistor socket instead of an actual transistor so the transistors can be swapped to explore noise characteristics.  
Note that if using a standard 2N3904 transistor, the pinout is reversed and the transistor should be inserted rotated 180 degres.
The Collector is not connected, and is indicated by "!!!" on the rear for reverse-biased base-emitter noise generation,
