## üñ®Ô∏è Laser Cut Side Panels

Laser cutting files are provided in this folder. These include SVGs for the laser cutter, preview PNGs, and SCAD (OpenSCAD) files for parametric editing.

### Files:

- **[`Eurorack_2D_2.0_12-24-20.svg`](Eurorack_2D_2.0_12-24-20.svg)**  
  Recommended side panel design for cutting  
  Each piece is approximately 6.25" x 6.5"
  The pieces should be placed with angled pieces facing each other to fit close.
  Save the extra plastic to cut your other modules later
- **Eurorack_2D_1.0_12-6-20.svg / .png / .scad**  
  Earlier versions
- **Eurorack_6_commonvector.svg**  
  For quickly cutting may panels at once
- **.scad files**  
  Parametric CAD models for customization (use with [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org))

Make sure to check measurements before cutting! If you're not using the campus laser cutter, be sure to scale the SVG to real-world units in your cutting software.
